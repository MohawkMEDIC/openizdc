 *             An Act, in the context of the reference information model (RIM) represents something that is done to a patient. More precisely, an Act
 *             is anything that occurs involving entities in which the entity's state is changed or is documented.
 *             
 *             Examples of Acts Include:
 *              - The administration of a substance to a patient - The observing of a value for the patient - An encounter or visit that occurs where the patient receives one or more services - Any other action such as supply request, or problem recordation
 *             The property which classifies what specific type of action an act represents is its , which dictates
 *             what type an act is. Class concept keys can be found in here .
 *             
 *             This structure is used to represent events, proposals, and requests. That is to say, the Act structure can represent the request to 
 *             do an act, the intent to perform an act, or the actual act being performed itself. This classification of mode happens based on the
